# Day 24

Initially I got excited about this problem because it was finally an interpreter problem!  I love these ones that involve simulating various fake machines.  They even made a monad joke!

However, the problem is really not about actually running the program.  Instead of writing code this problem is all about reading and understanding the code.  That's annoying because I enjoy writing this stuff.  However, it's a good skill to have.

I'll admit that I just cribbed my solution from [David Philipson's solution](https://github.com/dphilipson/advent-of-code-2021/blob/d3ccbe8d00beff2865476a106b08570cc3bd49e2/src/days/day24.rs).  I was not interested in spending my vacation disassembling. :D
