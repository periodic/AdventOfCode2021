# Day 3

My first thought when I saw part 1 was to use linear algebra to solve the problem, but I was pretty sure that wouldn't extend to the complication of part 2, so I decided against it.

I also made the decision to wrap up the readings as lists of integers, which I later refactored to `Vector`s. This possibly just complicated the problem more than I would have liked.  At it's heart these are bit vectors but I didn't want to have to remember how to build and use bit vectors on the fly.
